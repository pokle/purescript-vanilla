# Vanilla

I want to see if I can get fast purescript typesafe user interfaces by going straight to the DOM. As an added challenge, I also want to render when the DOM is unavailable - on the server side.

## Work in progress
- Trying to nut out the [design.md](design.md) right now.

## Trying it out
- Ensure you have the purescript essentials installed globally - pulp, bower 
- run `make`
- Open output/index.html in a browser
